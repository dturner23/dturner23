My Personal Repository

Hi there, my name is Dustin Turner.

After spending nearly 10 years in the Army, I transitioned into a role working with strategic IT initiatives. I quickly fell in love with understanding as much about the wide range of topics as I could. 

I'm now working as an IT Project Manager and learning to code through the Coding Dojo bootcamp. The process of writing code, seeing immediate feedback, and building a foundation to develop software products is proving to be extremely rewarding. 

I've built a website to start documenting the journey and write about other topics that interest me. 

Feel free to reach out if there is anything I can do to help!
