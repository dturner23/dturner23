<h3 align="center">I'm a lifelong learner from Nashville, TN</h3>

- After spending nearly 10 years in the Army, I transitioned into a role working with clients on strategic IT initiatives. I was exposed to everything from overall IT business strategy, data management and governance, customer experience, and more. I enjoyed it all, but was looking to get more involved with hands on IT projects.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JS, and plan to move to the MERN stack after I have a good grasp on the front-end. 

- 📝 I'm working as a freelance writer and Wordpress developer as I expand my development skills. I'm regularly writing articles on [dustinbturner.com](https://dustinbturner.com) for a wide range of topics.
